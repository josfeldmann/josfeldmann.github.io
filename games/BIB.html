	<h3>About</h3>

	<p>
		Bert is Bald is the passion project of one of the former Vice President, Evan Zhang. 
		After college he set out to create a procedurally generated twin stick shooter with a weapon crafting system.
		The game was supposed to take place in a randomly generated dungeon/world with 5 floors/levels, metroidvania style locked doors and world structure, and randomized loot that would encourage exploration throughout the large generated levels.
		He spent about a year working on the game before putting it on hiatus to look for a job.
		He left us with a fun demo of the first world complete with animations, level generation, and a boss fight.
		Click on the link above to download and play his demo.

			<h3>Development</h3>
			<p>
			   The game was made over the course of about a year and a half in the Unity engine, with serious development taking place after Evan graduated.
			   After graduting he began working on the game full time and hired artists and animators to create art assets, including a former club member!
			   During the games development time Evan asked for other club members to playtest his game and give him bug reports and feedback.
			   Despite being put on hiatus for now, this project is a good example of far a dedicated member of our club can take their idea, and showcases the importance of animation and high quality art assets in making a game look polished and unique.
