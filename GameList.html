          "description":"For a long time this was considered the best written video game of all time. It is an old school DND based Infinity Engine CRPG. While there is combat, a lot of it can be avoided by just running or talking to people. You play as the Nameless One, an immortal being who has lost his memory. You must explore and talk to characters to uncover your past, remember who you are, and shape your new future. The game is very text heavy, often you have to read long descriptions and paragraphs of text at a time. It can feel like reading a book, but you still have a good degree of player choice.",

The story focuses on the fraught relationship between Kratos and his son Atreus. They must work together to escape the wrath of the Norse gods and learn about eachother. The characters are constatly talking to eachother and building their relationships. Amazing voice acting, beatiful visuals and cinematography, and great action gameplay.",
